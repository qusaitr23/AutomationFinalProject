Hello,</br>
This is our Automation Final Project.</br>
we made this project to implement our automation skills that acquires in the "FullStack QA Automation " course.</br>
([By Yoni Flenner](https://atidcollege.co.il/))</br>
The project infrastructure was created from scratch.</br>
This project was made on the "Grafana" platform. ([Grafana](https://grafana.com/)).</br>
Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.
In this project we were tested this platform in 2 ways: Web & API</br>
The web app receives username and password from sql server to login, performs additional tasks such as changing backgrounds, search extensions in search engine and logout</br>
Each platform has it's own tests flows, and test cases.</br>
Basically, we made 3 more projects: ukMortgageCalc, Todolist, Calculator. In each run, the automation creating 1 new ukMortgageCalc task, 1 Todolist task and 1 Calculator task.</br>
The ukMortgageCalc task tests on mobile environment the inputs 'amount', 'term', 'rate' and calculate the built-in function, after that we saved the results and after checking we delete the saved assignment. ([ukMortgageCalc APK - DownloadLink](https://grafana.com/)).
The Todolist task tests on electron environment by adding, renamming, deleting and checking-assignment tasks. ([Todolist.exe - DownloadLink](https://atidcollege.co.il/downloads/electron/ToDoList-Setup.exe)).</br>
The Calculator task tests different types of math operations such as multiplaction, adding, division, substraction on desktop environment. (built-in windows calculator).</br>
The logging credentials are stored in Data Base, by "[freemysqlhosting **Website**](https://www.freemysqlhosting.net/)" which we get from the DB by SQL query.</br>
